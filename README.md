# Mini_Shell
Here is a brief overview of how Minishell works:
```
    The user types a command at the command prompt.
    The shell parses the command and breaks it down into its constituent parts.
    The shell then executes the command, either by running a builtin command or by launching an external program.
    The shell returns the output of the command to the user.
```
